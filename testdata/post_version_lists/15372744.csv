So I have a small application with Spring Security installed and made users etc. 

**class Group extends User{
...
}**

**abstract class User{
    ...
}**

Question: Can I have multiple ""User"" being extended from the same ""Group""? The idea was to have multiple users within a group access this group's information etc. If so, how is this achieved?

Thank you all in advance"

To make the question more simple and straight forward, forget the class names. 

    class ABC extends XYZ{...}

    class XYZ{...}

Question: Can multiple instances of XYZ extend the same instance of ABC?"
