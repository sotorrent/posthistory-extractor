The problem is I don't want ""unselected"" Selects to pass their parameter to the URL and make the query string long and complicated. Plus, when the ""unselected"" Selects pass the default value it is something like ""Select Group"" which shows in the URL as ""Select+Group"".  I definitely want to use GET so I can copy/save links. How can I add the Select value(s) conditionally and not prevent the JS script from populating the options?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, here is a typical URL right now:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    mydomain.com/bn/products?Division=1&Group=Select+Group&Segment=Select+Segment&Category=Select+Category&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is what I want that URL to be for use with my .htaccess & RewriteRule:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    mydomain.com/bn/products/1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because Group, Segment and Category are not selected, their value pairs are making an unnecessary mess of the URL.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any suggestions would be appreciated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**MORE INFO**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm new to posting here and I don't understand where to add lengthy follow-ups. Here goes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the idea of intercepting and generating via JS a new URL based on selections made. One problem I'm having is the way the URL is created by the form:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    mydomain.com/bn/products?Division=1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A little background might be helpful. I'm using a content variable to retrieve page content from the database. All content except the site home page is displayed in the content directory (/bn). What is happening in the link above is that the content variable is already set (products), but the form is placing ? after the content variable.  Here is a simple RewriteRule that would work if the URL were written correctly:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    RewriteRule ^bn/products/([0-9-]+)$ /bn/index.php?content=products&Division=$1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can access my selection using the following URL:    `mydomain.com/bn/products/1` because it conforms to the rewrite rule. Likewise I can get there using the traditional:     `mydomain.com/bn/index.php?content=products&Division=$1`.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now I must confess that I am a PHP guy with very limited JS and jQuery experience. Shomz suggests     `onsubmit=""my_submit_function(); return false;""` in my_submit_function I could check for the value of the select     `var divValue = $('#Division').val()` and append it to a URL.  What I don't know is how I send the generated URL. Obviously I want the URL to be in the ""friendly"" form     `mydomain.com/bn/products/1`.  Could someone offer insight there?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many thanks.&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;**UPDATE**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have created a function to replace the URL created by the form with one generated by my JS conditions.
