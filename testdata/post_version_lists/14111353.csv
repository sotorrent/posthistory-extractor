Here is my code for searching bluetooth...

    bluetoothAdapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
	registerReceiver(ActionFoundReceiver, new IntentFilter(
				BluetoothDevice.ACTION_FOUND));

private final BroadcastReceiver ActionFoundReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {

		@Override
		public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
			// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			String action = intent.getAction();
			if (BluetoothDevice.ACTION_FOUND.equals(action)) {
				BluetoothDevice device = intent
						.getParcelableExtra(BluetoothDevice.EXTRA_DEVICE);
				btArrayAdapter.add(device.getName() + ""\\n""
						+ device.getAddress());
				btArrayAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
			}
		}
	};


and here is my code for sending data to printer..


    	BluetoothDevice mDevice=bluetoothAdapter.getRemoteDevice(""00:15:FF:F2:56:A4"");
							
								Method m=mDevice.getClass().getMethod(""createRfcommSocket"", new Class[] { int.class });
								mBTsocket=(BluetoothSocket)m.invoke(mDevice, 1);
								System.out.println(""Connecting....."");
								mBTsocket.connect();
								System.out.println(""Connected"");
								OutputStream os = mBTsocket.getOutputStream();
			                    os.flush();

			                    os.write(Receipt.getBytes());
//			                    mBTsocket.close();

when i write socket.close() , data is not getting print to printer as socket connection getting closed before printing data..and if i didnt write socket.close() then data is getting printed only once..i would not be able to print data second time until i restart bluetooth of my phone.

can any one have solution for it??? or is there any other way to get rid of this printing??
