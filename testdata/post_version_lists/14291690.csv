Update July 2016: I see this kind of feature added for GitLab EE (Enterprise Edition): [MR 249][6]

- Add ability to enter remote push URL under Mirror Repository settings
- Add implementation code to push to remote repository
- Add new background worker
- Show latest update date and sync errors if they exists.
- Sync remote mirror every hour.

Note that the recent `Remote Mirror Repository` ([issues 17940][7]) can be tricky:
