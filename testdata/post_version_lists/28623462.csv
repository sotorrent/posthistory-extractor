`pid` should be set to the process id of the java application to trace, replace `1` by `2` if you want to trace `stderr` vs `stdin`.";;

One way would be using `dtrace` which allows tracing processes even when they are already grabbed by a debugger or similar tool.

Should you want to see non displayable characters (in octal), you might use this slightly modified version:
