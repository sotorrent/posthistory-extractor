*Explanation*: For each row you create date sequences with the `Start` and `End` dates. After that you count the unique days with the `uniqueN` function. This is better than my old answer ( see below) because when there are days somewhere between `max(Start,End)` and `min(Start,End)` which are not present in the intervals, the old answer will count to many days.
