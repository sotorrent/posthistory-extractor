I have adapted [the answer in this question][1] to be presentable in a stacked bar plot. Everything works fine, however the values are not displaying correctly.


    dnom <- data.frame(Variant = sample(c(""iedere"",""elke""),size = 50,replace = TRUE),
            Region = sample(c(""VL"",""NL""),size = 50,replace = TRUE),
            PrecededByPrep = sample(c(""1"",""0""),size = 50,replace = TRUE),
            Person = sample(c(""person"",""no person""),size = 50,replace = TRUE),
            Time = sample(c(""time"",""no time""),size = 50,replace = TRUE))
    
    dnom_labs <- data.frame(table(dnom$Region))
    
    ggplot(dnom, aes(x=Region)) +
    		geom_bar(aes(fill=Variant)) + 
    		geom_text(data=dnom_labs, aes(x=Var1, label=Freq, y=Freq/2), size=3) +
    		labs(x=""Region"", y=""Frequencies"", title=""Distribution of variant"")

The output of this is:
![example][2]

As you can see, two things are wrong:

 1. The values displayed are those of the whole bar, not of the individual stacked bars; only one value is displayed instead of one for the pink and one for the blue part
 2. The value is centered in the whole bar, but not in the individual stacked bars

If possible, I'd like to extend this even further, [to a bivariate multiple plot][3].

I also tried applying [this solution][4]. However, something goes wrong when assigning my values. This is my code.

    dnom <- data.frame(Variant = sample(c(""iedere"",""elke""),size = 50,replace = TRUE),
            Region = sample(c(""VL"",""NL""),size = 50,replace = TRUE),

            Time = sample(c(""time"",""no time""),size = 50,replace = TRUE))
    
    
    dnom_labs <- data.frame(table(dnom$Region, dnom$Variant))
    Data <- ddply(dnom, .(Region), transform, pos = cumsum(dnom_labs) - (0.5 * dnom_labs))
    
    ggplot(Data, aes(x=Region, y = dnom_labs)) +

    		geom_text(aes(label = Frequency, y = pos), size = 3) +
