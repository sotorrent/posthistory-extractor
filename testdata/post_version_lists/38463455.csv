I would like to find the largest element in the list and zero out the rest of the elements. I am not looking for the index element just what the example shows:

So I would go from:

    a = [1,2,3]
to:

    b = [0,0,1]

Another example:

a = [1,2,20,5,99,70,35]

to

b = [0,0,0,0,1,0,0]

NOW: What if I had a list of lists, and I want to go from:

    c = [ [33,6,3],[10,50,20],[4,9,77] ]

to

    d = [ [1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1] ]
